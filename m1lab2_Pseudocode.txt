1. Initialize fastest_time to a large number (e.g., infinity) and fastest_route to 0.
2. Initialize route_counter to 1.
3. While the user wants to enter more routes:
   a. Prompt for distance in miles.
   b. Validate distance (must be greater than 0).
   c. Prompt for speed in miles per hour.
   d. Validate speed (must be greater than 0).
   e. Calculate time in minutes using the formula: time = (distance / speed) * 60.
   f. Display the time for the current route.
   g. If the current route's time is less than fastest_time:
      i. Update fastest_time and fastest_route.
   h. Ask if the user wants to enter more routes.
4. Display the fastest route and its time.
